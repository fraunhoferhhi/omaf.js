 1.    INTRODUCTION
The Fraunhofer OMAF Javascript Player ("OMAF Javascript Player") is software that implements the MPEG ISO/IEC 23090-2:2017 Omnidirectional Media Format ("OMAF") HEVC-based viewport-dependent OMAF video profile ("VDP") for storage and distribution of VR360 video.

The Fraunhofer OMAF Javascript Player implementation consists of:
1. JavaScript Player (source code)
2. Content Creation Tools omaf-file-creation (python script + binaries)

The VDP Profile of the MPEG-OMAF standard allows distribution of VR360 video with higher resolution compared to encoding the whole VR360 video in a single stream. The VDP Profile spatially segments the video into HEVC tiles and packaging the tiles in a way that the receiver can request the high-definition tiles for the user‘s viewport and low-definition tiles for the areas out of sight. At the receiver the tiles are aggregated into a single HEVC compliant video stream that can be decoded with a legacy HEVC video decoder and rendered to the screen.
